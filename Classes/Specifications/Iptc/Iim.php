     * #UNO#
     *
     * Optional, not repeatable. Minimum of 14 and maximum of 80 octets consisting of graphic characters. Colon `:` and
     * solidus `/` are only allowed as specified, the asterisk `*` and question mark `?` are not allowed.
     *
     * UNO Unique Name of Object, providing eternal, globally unique identification for objects as specified in the IIM,
     * independent of provider and for any media form. The provider must ensure the UNO is unique. Objects with the same
     * UNO are identical.
     *
     * The UNO consists of four elements and provides the following functionality:
     * * **UNO Creation Date (UCD)**
     *
     *   Specifies a 24 hour period in which the further elements of the UNO have to be unique. It also provides a
     *   search facility.
     * * **Information Provider Reference (IPR)**
     *
     *   A name, registered with the IPTC/NAA, identifying the provider that guarantees the uniqueness of the UNO. It
     *   may assist in locating an object source.
     * * **Object Descriptor Element (ODE)**
     *
     *   In conjunction with the UCD and the IPR, a string of characters ensuring the uniqueness of the UNO. The
     *   provider may structure the element by use of a solidus `/` character.
     * * **Object Variant Indicator (OVI)**
     *
     *   A string of characters indicating technical variants of the object such as partial objects, or changes of file
     *   formats, and coded character sets.
     *
     * ##Rules##
     * The rules for the generation of the UNO are:
     * * The first three elements of the UNO (the UCD, the IPR and the ODE) together are allocated to the editorial
     *   content of the object.
     * * Any technical variants or changes in the presentation of an object, e.g. a picture being presented by a
     *   different file format, does not require the allocation of a new ODE but can be indicated by only generating a
     *   new OVI.
     *
     * ##Links##
     * Links may be set up to the complete UNO but the structure provides for linking to selected elements, e.g. to all
     * objects of a specified provider.
     *
     * ##UNO Component Definitions##
     * * **ES** (Element Separator)
     *
     *   Separates the elements within a UNO and consists of a single colon `:` character. All ES' are mandatory but
     * must not appear within an element.
     * * **ESD** (Element SubDivider)
     *
     *   Subdivides the ODE or OVI at the discretion of the provider and consists of a single solidus `/` character.
     * * **IPR** (Information Provider Reference)
     *
     *   Second element of the UNO. A minimum of one and a maximum of 32 octets. A string of graphic characters, except
     *   colon `:` solidus `/`, asterisk `*` and question mark `?`, registered with, and approved by, the IPTC.
     *   A list of registered strings of the IPR is located in Appendix E.
     * * **ODE** (Object Descriptor Element)
     *
     *   Third element of the UNO. A minimum of one and a maximum of 60 minus the number of IPR octets, consisting of
     *   graphic characters, except colon `:` asterisk `*` and question mark `?`. The provider bears the responsibility
     *   for the uniqueness of the ODE within a 24 hour cycle.
     * * **OVI** (Object Variant Indicator)
     *
     *   Fourth element of the UNO. A minimum of one and a maximum of 9 octets, consisting of graphic characters, except
     *   colon `:`, asterisk `*` and question mark `?`. To indicate a technical variation of the object as so far
     *   identified by the first three elements. Such variation may be required, for instance, for the indication of
     *   part of the object, or variations of the file format, or coded character set. The default value is a single
     *   `0` (zero) character indicating no further use of the OVI.
     * * **UCD** (UNO Creation Date)
     *
     *   First element of the UNO. 8 octets in ISO 8601 date format (CCYYMMDD), consisting of numeric characters.
     * * **UNO** (Unique Name of Object)
     *
     *   A universally unique name consisting of four elements. Total UNO has a minimum of 14 and maximum of 80 octets.
